                <h2>Current</h2>
                Currently I am a Junior at Northwest Missouri State University (Maryville, MO) pursuing a <i>Bachelor's in Computer
                Science</i>. 
                <br>
                I am employed by Nucor-LMP here in Maryville, and am interning as an onsite PC Technician. My daily tasks consist
                of responding to help desk tickets, of which are submitted by the users on campus if they are having any issues
                with the technology that is provided to them. I have dealt with a list of devices, including
                personal computer's(laptop and desktop), two-way radio's, personal scanner's, handheld scanner's, tag printer's,
