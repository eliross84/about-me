## About
This repository will be used for displaying my work and portfolio for future employers and fellow developers to look at and evaluate my work.

## Recommended Tools
There are many tools of which are very helpful when creating a repository through Github Pages such as...
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is very helpful when laying out and editing simple text, such as the markdown language that is used to create this page!
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.6.2.html) is another very useful tool for displaying any programming language and formatting it the way the user would like.
- In order to create a basic text file as such, a user must be familiar with Markdown
